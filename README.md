# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Greetings,

I am Muskanpreet, and I am excited to share my project focused on predicting medical insurance costs using advanced machine learning techniques. This project involved the use of Linear Regression and Decision Trees to model and forecast insurance expenses based on various features.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
The primary objective of this project was to develop predictive models that can estimate medical insurance costs based on a range of input features. The project utilized two key machine learning algorithms:


Linear Regression: To capture and model the linear relationships between the features and the target variable (insurance cost).

Decision Trees: To handle non-linear relationships and provide interpretability through tree-based modeling.

<h3>Key Steps and Techniques</h3>
<h4>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</h4>

Data Acquisition: The dataset used includes information on medical insurance policies, such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and duplicate values.

<h3>Model Development:</h3>

Linear Regression: Applied Linear Regression to establish baseline predictions and understand linear relationships between features and insurance costs.

Decision Tree Regression: Implemented Decision Tree Regression to explore and model non-linear relationships and capture complex interactions.
<h3>Model Evaluation:</h3>

Evaluated the performance of both models and checked accuracy score.
Compared model results to determine the best-performing algorithm for predicting insurance costs.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly in predicting medical insurance costs. By leveraging Linear Regression and Decision Trees, I have created a robust analytical framework for forecasting and understanding insurance expenses.

I invite you to explore this project to gain insights into predictive modeling techniques and their applications in the field of medical insurance.

Best Regards,

Muskanpreet
